Polynomial Commitment based on Kate et al. 2010
===============================================

Install Dependencies
--------------------

The library depends on GMP. Install it by `apt install libgmp-dev`.

To install the mcl library (for elliptical curve computation), run the following:

git submodule init
git submodule update
cd mcl && make

Your dynamic library loader needs to be able to find the mcl shared libraries.
Run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)/mcl/lib`.

Library
-------

To build the library, run `make static`. Include "polycommit_bn.h" for BN254 curve
(100 bit security) and "polycommit_bls.h" for BLS12-381 (128 bit security). Link
against "libpolycommitbn.a" and "libpolycommitbls.a" respectively when building.

Demo and Benchmark
------------------

Run `make binary`.
