We need to make sure that there should be no chance of inconsistency.
E.g. in the case of merkle tree, 4096 leaves are encoded while only
2048 are needed to determine the original data. This provides room of
inconsistency. So, conclusion 1: encode exactly 2048 values.

Next, let's review the complexity of each operation. Assuming each
block is n field elements.

		Computation	Communnication
Commitment	O(n)		O(1)
Witness		O(n)		O(1)
Verify		O(1)		N/A

However, if we are able to split the polynomial into smaller parts
and commit to each of them. For example, suppose that we chop the
degree-n polynomial into m chunks, such that n % m = 0.
